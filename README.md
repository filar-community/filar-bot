**Unofficial FILAR moderation Discord bot**

---

This Discord bot includes several features:

## Ticket System

- Provides a persistent button labeled **"Create Ticket"**.
- When a user clicks the button, it creates a **private text channel** (ticket) visible only to:
  - the user,
  - staff members,
  - and the bot.
- Prevents users from opening multiple tickets simultaneously.
- Ticket owners or staff can use the `!close` command to close and delete the ticket channel.

## Anti-Raid Verification

- On member join, the bot sends a **DM with a simple math question**.
- The user must answer correctly within **2 minutes** or be automatically kicked.
- Helps protect the server from automated bot raids.

## Self-Assign Roles

- Posts a message with **emojis linked to specific roles**.
- Users can react to the message to **assign or remove roles**.
- Role assignments are handled automatically when users react or unreact.

## Reaction Tracker

- Automatically adds **üëç and üëé reactions** to messages in a specified channel.
- The `!reactions` command displays a **summary of recent reactions** in that channel.

## Link Filtering

- **Deletes messages containing links** (`http://` or `https://`) in channels where links are not allowed.
- Sends a **DM warning** to the user explaining why their message was removed.
- Allows **channel-specific exceptions** where links are permitted.

## Temporary and Permanent Ban Command

- Provides a `!ban` command for moderators with ban permissions.
- Supports **temporary bans** (e.g., `7d`, `12h`) or **permanent bans**.
- Automatically **unbans users** after their ban duration expires, if temporary.
